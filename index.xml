&lt;h2 id="the-suns-path">The Sun's Path&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On a Flat Earth, the sun follows a circular path above the Earth, tracing the line of the Equator during the equinoxes, the Tropic of Cancer during the Summer Solstice, and the Tropic of Capricorn during the Winter Solstice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="daynight-pattern--light-propagation">Day/night Pattern / Light Propagation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One common argument against the Local Sun is that, &amp;quot;the entire Earth should all be daytime at once.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this can be explained by the ability of light to penetrate the atmosphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This same effect can be replicated at home using a flashlight and a variety of atmospheric conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you live in an area prone to forest fires, you are likely already familiar with how different the sky, distant landscape, and celestial bodies are when smoke is in the air.
If fog is common in your area, you are likely familiar with the light-hampering effects of fog.
If the humidity level swings between dry and wet, you will also see an effect.
If you live near an industrial site which kicks up particles into the air, you should be able to tell a difference as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hot-spot-under-sun-over-water">Hot Spot under sun over water&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Next time that you are looking out at the ocean, pay attention to the surface of the water. You will notice that there is a hot spot beneath the sun's current position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is this consistent with an object sitting at 90+ million miles away?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fan-out-of-rays-through-the-clouds">Fan-out of rays through the clouds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You've likely also seen the sun's rays fanning out from the clouds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is this consistent with an object sitting at 90+ million miles away?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or is this more consistent with a local sun?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
