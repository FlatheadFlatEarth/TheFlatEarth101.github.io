## Heliocentric Model - Tilt

According to the Heliocentric Model, Earth is tilted at 23.4 degrees.
23.4 = (90 - 66.6).

During the North American Summer, Earth is tilted TOWARDS the Sun, but further from it.

During the North American Winter, Earth is tilted AWAY from the Sun, but closer to it.

In every context that the author is familiar with, the conduction of heat is based primarily on proximity and the materials involved.

In what other context can we reproduce the findings of the heliocentric model, that the *tilt* rather than the proximity accounts for such a drastic temperature difference?

Try this at the campfire. Does a roasting marshmallow respond primarily to its angle towards the campfire or its proximity?

## Local Sun - Proximity

On a Flat Earth, the [Local Sun](//post/local_sun) follows a circular path above the Earth, tracing the line of the Equator during the equinoxes,  the Tropic of Cancer during the Summer Solstice, and the Tropic of Capricorn during the Winter Solstice.

Thus, depending on the time of year, the Sun will be more or less proximate to different areas on the Earth. The closer the Sun, the warmer it will be. The further, the colder.
