## Hubble on Geocentrism

Discussing different assumptions:

> The assumption of uniformity has much to be said in its favour. If the distribution were not uniform, it
> would either increase with distance, or decrease. But we would not expect to find a distribution in which
> the density increases with distance, symmetrically in all directions. Such a condition would imply that
> we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central
> earth. The hypothesis cannot be disproved but it is unwelcome and would be accepted only as a last
> resort in order to save the phenomena. Therefore, we disregard this possibility and consider the
> alternative, namely, a distribution which thins out with distance.

> Both explanations seem plausible, but neither is permitted by the observations. The apparent departures
> from uniformity in the World Picture are fully compensated by the minimum possible corrections for
> redshifts on any interpretation. No margin is left for a thinning out. The true distribution must either be
> uniform or increase outward, leaving the observer in a unique position. But the unwelcome supposition
> of a favoured location must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, we accept the uniform distribution, and
> assume that space is sensibly transparent. Then the data from the surveys are simply and fully accounted
> for by the energy corrections alone - without the additional postulate of an expanding universe.
