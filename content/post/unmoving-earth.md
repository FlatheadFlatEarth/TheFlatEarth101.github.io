## No Rotation

as of 2019 no tests have provided conclusive proof of any Earth rotation.

## No Precession

### Foucault's Pendulum

Foucault’s
Writings and commentaries in 1851 indicate strong evidence that the precession of the pendulums is merely the result of friction in the mechanical pivot.

Some models built with great care by noted scientists failed to precess as fast or as slow as Foucault claimed they should.

many constructions of a Foucault pendulum require adjustments to obtain the predicted results. This fact was stated in July of 1851 by George Biddle Airy then astronomer Royal.

 in 2001 a Foucault pendulum was constructed at the south pole in the stairwell of a newly constructed research station. It has been claimed that this verified Foucault’s theory. But these excerpts from the report prove that adjustments had to be made to obtain the desired results.
“A hole was drilled through a length of 2×4 through which the pendulum’s wire was fixed in such a way that it would have freedom of movement in all directions. The 2×4 was then fixed to the top of the stairwell and the wire suspended down into the stairwell.”

“There was no mechanism for keeping the pendulum swinging and the amplitude decayed within a couple of hours so it had to be restarted periodically over the 24 hour period.”
“Our first attempt with the pendulum showed the Earth spinning backward from what was expected. We didn’t notice this at first because we’re all from the Northern Hemisphere and are accustomed to the earth spinning in an anticlockwise direction. We then realized that from our frame of reference the earth should be spinning clockwise so we had to modify the pendulum.”
“Our second attempt showed the earth rotating in the proper direction but at an angular velocity twice what is expected (ire., 12 hour days instead of 24). We suspected some kind of government conspiracy but decided to make a further modification and try it again.”

“It was difficult to make the pendulum swing in a plane instead of an ellipse. After several attempts with various techniques of holding the bob and dropping it we always got some kind of ellipse instead of a plane. This adds to our error because it is more difficult to locate and mark the pendulum arc’s apex. A way to do it is to suspended the bob by tying it off with a piece of string and letting it settle, then burn through the string. The bob would then drop without any outside force and swing in a plane. Since it is against the Antarctica Treaty to have any open flames at the South Pole we could not do this. After much practice Mike Town got very adept at dropping the bob so that it arced in a plane.”
