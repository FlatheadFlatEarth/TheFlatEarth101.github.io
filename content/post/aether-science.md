Before [Einstein](/post/einstein/), scientists believed that, rather than space being empty, that there was a substance which permeated space which enabled electromagnetic waves to propagate.

According to mainstream science, the validity of the aether theory was invalidated through a series of experiments performed near the turn of the 20th century.

Let's take a moment to look at two of the foremost experiments which overturned the consensus belief in the Aether.

## Michelson-Morely

"According to the stationary and the partially dragged aether hypotheses, Earth and the aether are in relative motion, implying that a so-called "aether wind" (Fig. 2) should exist.

By analyzing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times, it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the aether."

## Modern Explanation

"With aether, the light speed of about 300,000 km per second, must be seen, in spite of the the incredible speed of light, as a limitation of the aether to transmit electromagnetic changes."
- [Citation](http://paradox-paradigm.nl/wp-content/uploads/Unbelievable.pdf)

"When a charged mass in an electric field with aether is accelerated, then the particle
can of course not be accelerated to the speed of light, because of irrefutable empirical
knowledge. With aether, the cause for this does not lie with the relativity of time and
space, but with the inert quality of the aether."

"The relaxing electric field passes the energy to the aether in the form of electromagnetic vibration (radiation), at the spot where the charge was situated dt seconds earlier."

"The aether must be made of positive and negative charges and must
be encapsulated in an entity we call the point volume."
