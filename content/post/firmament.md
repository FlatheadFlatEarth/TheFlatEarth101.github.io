The firmament is thought of as a dome enclosing the Earth.

This is a very uncomfortable thought for most people, as we have been taught to look forward to the infinite freedom to explore outer space.

However, the idea has a huge amount of precedent.

## Square and Compass

Interestingly, the Freemasons use a Square and Compass as their primary symbol, and Albert Pike, one of the most celebrated and influential of the Freemasons, openly acknowledges the symbolism of the Square representing the Earth and the Compass representing the heavens.

"The Square is a right angle, formed by two right lines. It is adapted only to a plane
surface, and belongs only to geometry, earth-measurement, that trigonometry which
deals only with planes, and with the earth, which the ancients supposed to be a plane.

The Compass describes circles, and deals with spherical trigonometry, the science of the
spheres and-heavens. The former, therefore, is an emblem of what concerns the earth
and the body; the latter of what concerns the heavens and the soul. Yet the Compass is
also used in plane trigonometry, as in erecting perpendiculars; and, therefore, you are
reminded that, although in this Degree both points of the Compass are under the Square,
and you are now dealing only with the moral and political meaning of the symbols, and
not with their philosophical and spiritual meanings, still the divine ever mingles with the
human; with the earthly the spiritual intermixes; and there is something spiritual in the
commonest duties of life."
