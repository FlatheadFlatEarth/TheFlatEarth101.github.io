If your experience in anything like mine, you wrote off the Flat Earth as a huge steaming pile of bunk when you first encountered it.

But, somehow, someway, you made it back here. For me, it took at least three or four exposures before I realized that there was something to it.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad information out there, whether deliberate or accidental, so this website is my humble attempt to gather the most credible evidence and arguments in one place.

My hope is that you will then use your own eyes, ears, reason, and intuition, in order to arrive at the truth.

Best of luck on your journey,
