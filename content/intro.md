It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong. 

-- Richard P. Feynman

Most of us have been indoctrinated so deeply that we truth others blindly. We put much of our faith in theories that have not been proven by empirical evidence.

The goal of this wiki is to establish, entirely based on empirical evidence, a true model of the shape and character of of the Earth.


"My experience with science in the fields of physics and economics is that in general scientists apply learned knowledge without validating whether in that specific situation the applied science is valid."
- Carel van der Togt 


"Positivism is the philosophy that knowledge, science, can only be based on observable,
empirical facts"
